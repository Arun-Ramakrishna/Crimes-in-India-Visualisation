# Crimes-in-India-Visualisation
Tableau Dashboard 

The datasets used for this project are Homicide dataset (2001-2010) and Cause for Homicide (2001-2010). So, these datasets are used to visualize homicides data in India from 2001 to 2010. After much deliberation and consideration the following graphs were selected to visualize and present the given data to the viewers in the best possible way.
Map graph to display which state in country is witnessing the most homicides and over the course of ten years. This also gives the user the option to select the year of interest to see the relevant crime data.
Bar graph which shows the reason or the cause behind the homicide across different states. After seeing the bar graph the user will be informed about most common reason which resulted in the homicide.
Lastly the Bubble graph to visualize the distribution of homicides among different age group of victims.
